This is my (Jerome Sipin) submission for the intro to Python homework. As instructed, each part of the homework is in its own folder, with resources and outputs also having a
folder within.

I have also included my thought process when thinking about how to handle each problem in the document "Python Homework Strategies.txt". I mainly wrote this up
last week to remember how I wanted to solve the homework when I got the chance to work on it. I also thought it would be effective in showing
that I did not copy/paste from somewhere, because I didn't think I would commit more than once. However, committing to GitHub turned out to be
fairly quick, so I made multiple commits anyways.
